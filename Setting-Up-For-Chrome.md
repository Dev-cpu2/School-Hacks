**Setting Up**
Go over to the *Web Store* and download the •Browser Lock• Extentsion.
This is ESSENTIAL for this to work.

**After Download**
Open up the extention and a popup will appear for where you need you to sign in with a password which will allow you to sign back into your chrome. 
[Disclaimer] make a password that you can remember since as far as i know you cannot login into your chrome if you dont place your password you cannot access it.
after logging in go to the settings area.
Enable the *Auto Lock** Feature within it (it might be enabled by default). this will make it so whenever you leave chrome or close it, it will enable a 'lock-down' feature which will require a password.
to login to your chrome.
Set the *Run In Background* to yes and the set the state when opened to *Start with a new tab*
**Quarantine Mode**
If you want to enable MAXIUM incognito within your chrome you should enable this feature. this will allow you to delete your history while the teacher is looking.
For this to happen make the lockdown timer to **1 Minute** and make the *Maximum Attempts* to 2 so that it gives you 1 extra attempt if you accidentally type it wrong.
Furthurmore make the *CLear History* function to Clear, also make the *How Many Days of Data Should Be Cleared* to 1 year which will clear almost ALL of your data/history which is
more than enough for your history to be safe. To be extra safe. if youve used chrome for over a year i would suggest to delete all your data manually to be safe when your teacher is 
peaking and snooping through your history.
Also you should select the 2 buttons 'Downloads' and 'History' in the *Which of Your Data Should be Deleted* section. which will delete the history or data
**Quick Lock**
This is the combination which will allow you to Lock Chrome manually. If your on mac i would suggest using Command Or Control Q for the quick lock.
This is make it so that even if you cant close chrome with pressing the X button you can do it with the comfort of your key-binds.
