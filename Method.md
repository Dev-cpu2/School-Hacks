**The Method**
If you are on mac you can delete tabs on chrome with cmd + w or if you have only one tab you can close chrome. So if you are on the first tab
you can use cmd + w to close chrome and to enable the auto lock when you open chrome up again. If the teacher asks u to place the code you should place the code wrong until it enters 
*Quarantine Mode* this will be where your history and tabs get deleted. *Warning* your tabs will not be deleted unless you do cmd + W this is what deletes the tabs on **MAC** and **WINDOWS**

**So Far this it for the Method, Thank You**

I will post more info on school hacks and more!
