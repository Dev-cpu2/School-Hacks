**The Method**
Well i wont be yapping alot since theres not rlly a method that you need to follow so you can kinda skip this but if you are new to VPN's i would suggest staying.
So what you want to know is that this VPN will not work outside of chrome only inside of it but if you want to use it for outside of chrome i would suggest turning on your vpn and then 
search up VeePN download to download the app the reason why you need to use the VeePN first is because you need to go through the potential 'Fire Wall'
that your school put up to disable you from downloading it.

**After The Download Of The App**
After downloading i would follow the 'Setting up for chrome VPN' Steps to set up the app version but yeah thats all thanks for reading!

**[Disclaimer]** 
If your schools Fire Wall is strong then some games like 'Roblox' And others wont probably work.
