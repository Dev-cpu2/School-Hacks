**Setting Up**
Welcome to setting up!

All youll need is to go to the file 'Links.md' and copy the VeePN link and search it. then add the extention.
After adding it your done with the setting up part!

**After Download**
After downloading it you want to open it up and create an account use a email and password. after completing i would suggest using either the USA Server Or UK Server since these are
the main countrys with the language being English.

After doing all of this head over to 'Method.md'
